Introduction should answer the following questions, ideally in this order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the nature of the problem the thesis is addressing?
\item What is the common approach for solving that problem now?
\item How this thesis approaches the problem?
\item What are the results? Did something improve?
\item What can the reader expect in the individual chapters of the thesis?
\end{enumerate}
